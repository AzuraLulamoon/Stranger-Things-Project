# Stranger-Things-Project
 This is my stranger things project, it includes
 
 -functioning nav bar with link routing
 
 -login and creation page with API

 -posts page with all post from every user on the site via API

 -profile page with myposts board as well as a message board where sent and recieved messages can be read

-post page also includes a functioning search engine to filter through currently visable posts as well as a message button
to send messages to the authors of the selected post. Also includes a built in filter to filter out inactive posts

Link to deployed version here: https://64d055d78a3f38201f1934f6--hilarious-flan-dd32a7.netlify.app
    -NOTE, KNOWN BUG: THE DEPLOYED VERSION AUTOMATIC REDIRECT IS CURRENTLY BROKEN, ERROR 404 IS ENCOUNTERED WHEN THE SITE ATTEMPTS TO REDIRECT, CAUSE UNKNOWN. WHEN ON THE SITE SIMPLY HIT THE BACK BUTTON AFTER YOU HIT THE ERROR OR REMOVE THE
    /Profile EXTENTION FROM YOUR URL BAR.
        -for whatever reason the non deployed version doesnt have this issue when running npm dev, no idea what causing it to break although i assume it has something to do with the way i have structured my routes.
